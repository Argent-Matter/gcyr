## ideas

- you must maintain satellites. If you fail to do so, they will fall down (explode on the ground) and leave space debris.
- if you accumulate enough space debris, it'll become impossible to launch new satellites.
- the dyson sphere must also be maintained. Failing to do so will implode the sphere into the sun and prevent building of new ones.
- if a player leaves a dyson sphere running for too long, they'll have to take vitamin D supplements. not taking them will cause cardiac arrest (death)
- Ore mining lasers. May be used for nefarious purposes.
- Building a dyson sphere will cause all dyson swarm satellites' power output to nullify.

After the hub structure is launched i dont think the station structure itself should have any sort of requirements beyond the usual oxygen checks. The main requirements should be the existence of the required multiblocks and them all being connected to one another via something, maybe some sort of cable idk. That way people can design and build the overall station however they want with the only main hard requirements being the multiblocks. Drone hangar and the reciever/transmitter array should have some sort of requirement to have one end exposed in space

My guess is having some sort of multiblock built on world before launching it that “becomes” the station. Or a series of multi blocks and its built in sections like the ISS (though that sounds painfully script heavy to have a multi-stage multi launch multiblock build to create a space station)

Theres the galacticraft way of just having some sort of prefab starting station given you have the required materials in inventory to make it.

That last one could be married to the first one, having to build a prefab “hub” module that has all the requirements for life (no leaks, o2 production, power, etc) before its launched, then once the hub is in position you build it out. Probably gonna need multiple multiblocks to give the project the grand scale. Like, needs a drone hanger for building the dyson sphere/drone satellite hangar. Probably will require some kind of material upkeep. Need that laser reciever for the power coming frm the sphere (sun should probably be locked in a certain orientation in relation to the hub to simulate geo-stationary (or i guess sol-stationairy?) orbit. Then have the laser reciever facing the “sun”. Maybe require some sort of cooling system for the power lines or the station itself. Obviously a central computer to manage the automation of drones and power management.
Very complex but a project of that scale should feel grand
Hell maybe even throw in some kind of shield generator to protect the station
But for sure needs the computer, receiver, and the drone hangar
And i strongly believe the drone hangar should need some sort of material upkeep, either raw resources to keep it simple or a variety of drone parts/dyson sphere parts
To simulate the damage the structure will inevitably sustain due to being so close to the sun and the active process of maintaining it

Though we should also think how we are gonna handle multiplayer like, can only one person build a dyson sphere?

An idea i was working on was the concept of a wormhole generator/star gate/ eye of harmony etc that opens up a portal to a star /somewhere/ through which drones are sent to build the dyson sphere. Ideally this would be ok the station but this would be an alternative to the station requirement. Likely requiring the gate to be in some sort of sealed room as the “solar radiation and heat would kill anyone who stepped inside” (it would but also because this portal is non transversable and just a visual to represent the source of energy). Think like some sort of Half Life crystal chamber or something where theres the observation room and then the portal room inside some sort of super strong box capable of withstanding the forces. The laser would come thru the portal into a receiver block/multi block lined up with the center of the portal.  This portal idea allows for a tiered approach for dyson spheres allowing for larger and larger classes of star to be harnessed and potentially other celestial bodies.

Though the main idea is the concept of a portal to go around the fact that only one person could realistically build a dysonsphere around the MC star
Likely would be in a lagrange point in space because “such portals wont work within the gravity well of earth”. With that in mind the station itself would stay the same but just adding some sort of portal projector multiblock to the mix
